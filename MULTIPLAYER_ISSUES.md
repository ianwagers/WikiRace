# Multiplayer Client/Server Logic Issues

This document identifies critical issues in the WikiRace multiplayer implementation based on code review of recent commits and surrounding multiplayer code.

## Critical Issues

### 1. Port Mismatch Between Client and Server (CRITICAL)

**Location**: 
- `server/config.py` line 16: `PORT: int = 8001`
- `src/logic/Network.py` line 41: `server_url: str = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"`

**Issue**: The client defaults to connecting to port 8000, but the server is configured to run on port 8001. This will cause all connections to fail unless explicitly configured.

**Impact**: Severe - Multiplayer will not work at all without manual configuration.

**Evidence**:
```python
# server/config.py
PORT: int = 8001  # Changed from 8000 to avoid port conflicts

# src/logic/Network.py
def __init__(self, server_url: str = "http://127.0.0.1:8000"):  # Fixed to match server port
```

**Fix**: Change either client default to 8001 or server default to 8000, or add proper configuration sync.

### 2. Race Condition in Room State Validation

**Location**: `server/room_manager.py` lines 254-337 (leave_room method)

**Issue**: The `leave_room` method acquires locks and validates room state, but there's a race condition between checking `player_to_room` and acquiring locks. A player could be removed from another thread during this window.

**Impact**: Medium-High - Can cause player state inconsistencies during concurrent operations.

**Evidence**:
```python
async def leave_room(self, socket_id: str) -> Optional[GameRoom]:
    # Get room code WITHOUT lock
    room_code = self.player_to_room.get(socket_id)
    if not room_code:
        return None
    
    # Time window here - room_code could become invalid
    room_lock = await self._get_room_lock(room_code)
    player_lock = await self._get_player_lock(socket_id)
```

**Fix**: Use global lock for initial lookup or redesign locking strategy.

---

### 3. Duplicate Progress Update Methods

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` 

**Issue**: There are two sets of methods for sending player progress with different names and slightly different implementations:
- `send_player_progress()` (lines 667-688) - emits 'player_progress'
- `send_player_progress_update()` (lines 791-805) - also emits 'player_progress'

**Impact**: Medium - Confusing API, potential for inconsistent behavior.

**Evidence**:
```python
def send_player_progress(self, page_url: str, page_title: str):
    """Send detailed player progress update to server"""
    # ...
    self.sio.emit('player_progress', {...})

def send_player_progress_update(self, current_page: str, links_used: int):
    """Send player progress update to server"""
    # ...
    self.sio.emit('player_progress', {...})
```

**Fix**: Consolidate into a single method or clearly differentiate their purposes.

---

### 4. Connection Health Check During Reconnection

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 741-773 (`_is_connection_healthy`)

**Issue**: The health check returns `False` if `current_reconnection_attempts > 0`, but this prevents sending messages during the reconnection window when the connection might actually be restored.

**Impact**: Medium - Could prevent legitimate operations during reconnection.

**Evidence**:
```python
def _is_connection_healthy(self) -> bool:
    # ...
    # Check if we're in the middle of reconnection
    if self.current_reconnection_attempts > 0:
        return False  # This is too conservative
```

**Fix**: Check actual connection state instead of just attempt counter.

---

### 5. Synchronous Sleep in Async Context

**Location**: `src/gui/MultiplayerPage.py` line 913

**Issue**: Using synchronous `time.sleep(0.5)` in an event handler that should be non-blocking. This will freeze the UI.

**Impact**: Medium - Poor user experience, UI freezing.

**Evidence**:
```python
def _validate_room_exists(self, room_code):
    if hasattr(self.network_manager, 'connect_to_server'):
        self.network_manager.connect_to_server()
        # Give it a moment to connect
        import time
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Blocks UI thread!
```

**Fix**: Use QTimer or async/await properly.

---

### 6. Silent Fallback in Room Validation

**Location**: `src/gui/MultiplayerPage.py` lines 903-926, `src/logic/Network.py` lines 601-617

**Issue**: When room validation fails, the code silently returns `True` (assumes room exists), which defeats the purpose of validation.

**Impact**: Medium - Users can attempt to join non-existent rooms, leading to confusing error messages.

**Evidence**:
```python
def _validate_room_exists(self, room_code):
    try:
        # ... validation code ...
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error validating room existence: {e}")
        # If validation fails, assume room exists and let server handle it
        return True  # Silent failure!
```

**Fix**: Return False on validation failure and show proper error to user.

---

### 7. Rejoin During Active Game is Impossible (CRITICAL LOGIC BUG)

**Location**: 
- `server/room_manager.py` lines 292-299 (leave_room)
- `server/room_manager.py` lines 169-175 (join_room)

**Issue**: There's a fundamental contradiction in the rejoin logic:
1. When a player disconnects during an IN_PROGRESS game, `leave_room()` marks them as `disconnected=True` and keeps them in the room "for potential reconnection"
2. However, `join_room()` explicitly REJECTS joins to rooms in any state other than LOBBY or COMPLETED
3. This means a player who disconnects during a game can NEVER rejoin because join_room will reject them!

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Disconnected players can never rejoin active games, making the "mark as disconnected for rejoin" logic completely useless.

**Evidence**:
```python
# In leave_room:
if game_state == GameState.IN_PROGRESS:
    # Mark as disconnected but keep in room
    player.disconnected = True
    # Don't remove from player_to_room mapping during active games
    # This allows for potential reconnection  <-- BUT IT DOESN'T!

# In join_room:
if room.game_state not in [GameState.LOBBY, GameState.COMPLETED]:
    logger.warning(f"Room is in {room.game_state.value} state, cannot join")
    return None  # <-- Blocks all rejoins during IN_PROGRESS!
```

**Fix**: Add GameState.IN_PROGRESS to allowed states in join_room when handling a rejoin scenario (existing disconnected player).

---

### 8. Missing Transaction/Rollback in Redis Sync

**Location**: `server/room_manager.py` (various async methods)

**Issue**: Redis sync operations (`_sync_room_to_redis`) are called after modifying in-memory state, but there's no rollback mechanism if Redis sync fails.

**Impact**: Medium - Memory and Redis state can diverge.

**Evidence**: Throughout room_manager.py, pattern of:
```python
# Modify in-memory state
room.remove_player(socket_id)
# Then sync to Redis
await self._sync_room_to_redis(room)
# But if sync fails, no rollback!
```

**Fix**: Use transaction pattern or accept eventual consistency model.

---

### 9. Heartbeat Failure Triggers Reconnection Loop

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 453-464

**Issue**: When a heartbeat fails, it immediately triggers reconnection, which can create a reconnection loop if the server is temporarily slow but still connected.

**Impact**: Medium - Unnecessary disconnects and reconnects.

**Evidence**:
```python
def send_heartbeat(self):
    if self.connected_to_server and self.sio.connected:
        try:
            self.sio.emit('ping', {'timestamp': time.time()})
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"üíì Heartbeat failed: {e}")
            # Immediately triggers reconnection on ANY exception
            if self.reconnection_enabled:
                self._start_reconnection()
```

**Fix**: Allow multiple heartbeat failures before triggering reconnection.

---

### 10. Inactive Player Check Uses Wrong Variable

**Location**: `server/socket_handlers.py` line 121

**Issue**: The debug log uses `time_since_activity` which is defined inside the loop, but the log statement is outside the player loop, referencing the last player's value.

**Impact**: Low - Misleading debug logs.

**Evidence**:
```python
for socket_id, player in list(room.players.items()):
    time_since_activity = current_time - player.last_activity
    # ... check threshold ...
    if time_since_activity > inactive_threshold:
        inactive_players.append((socket_id, player))

# Remove inactive players
for socket_id, player in inactive_players:
    logger.warning(f"Removing inactive player {player.display_name}")
    # Uses time_since_activity from LAST player in previous loop!
    logger.warning(f"Player was inactive for {time_since_activity.total_seconds():.1f} seconds")
```

**Fix**: Calculate time_since_activity in the removal loop.

---

### 11. No Rate Limiting on Socket Events

**Location**: `server/socket_handlers.py` (all event handlers)

**Issue**: Socket event handlers have no rate limiting. A malicious or buggy client could flood the server with events.

**Impact**: High - Potential DoS vector.

**Evidence**: No rate limiting decorators or checks in any socket event handlers.

**Fix**: Implement per-client rate limiting on socket events.

---

### 12. Player Color State Synchronization Issue

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 188-206

**Issue**: When joining a room, the code explicitly avoids setting the current player's color from the server (`NOTE: Do not set current player's color from room_joined event`), but this could lead to desync if the server already has a color assigned.

**Impact**: Medium - Color inconsistencies between players.

**Evidence**:
```python
@self.sio.event
def room_joined(data):
    # ...
    # Create Player instances for all OTHER players in room
    # NOTE: Do not set current player's color from room_joined event
    # The current player manages their own color through UI interactions
```

**Fix**: Either trust server state or implement proper color conflict resolution.

---

### 13. Memory Leak in Lock Dictionaries

**Location**: `server/room_manager.py` lines 35-53

**Issue**: Lock dictionaries grow indefinitely as rooms and players are created. The `_cleanup_locks` method is called but may not always execute properly.

**Impact**: Medium - Memory leak over time.

**Evidence**:
```python
def __init__(self):
    self._room_locks: Dict[str, asyncio.Lock] = {}  # room_code -> lock
    self._player_locks: Dict[str, asyncio.Lock] = {}  # socket_id -> lock
    # These grow but are only cleaned up sporadically
```

**Fix**: Implement proper cleanup in all exit paths or use WeakValueDictionary.

---

### 14. Empty Room Timeout Too Long

**Location**: `server/socket_handlers.py` lines 89-95

**Issue**: Empty rooms are only closed after 5 minutes. Combined with the room creation limit per IP, this could prevent users from creating new rooms.

**Impact**: Medium - Resource waste and potential user frustration.

**Evidence**:
```python
# CRITICAL FIX: Close empty rooms after 5 minutes
if room.player_count == 0:
    time_since_creation = current_time - room.created_at
    if time_since_creation > timedelta(minutes=5):  # Too long!
```

**Fix**: Reduce to 1-2 minutes or implement immediate cleanup with grace period.

---

### 15. Inconsistent Error Handling in Socket Handlers

**Location**: `server/socket_handlers.py`

**Issue**: Some handlers use the `@handle_socket_error` decorator, but many others don't, leading to inconsistent error reporting.

**Impact**: Medium - Inconsistent error handling and logging.

**Evidence**: Only `disconnect` handler uses the decorator (line 208), but handlers like `connect`, `create_room`, `join_room`, etc. don't.

**Fix**: Apply decorator consistently or remove it entirely.

---

### 16. Start Game Button Race Condition

**Location**: `src/gui/MultiplayerPage.py` line 937

**Issue**: `update_start_game_button_state()` is called after resetting state, but there's no guarantee the room state has been updated from the server yet.

**Impact**: Low-Medium - Button may be in wrong state temporarily.

**Evidence**:
```python
def reset_for_new_game(self):
    # Clear state
    self._waiting_for_players_ready = False
    # Update button immediately
    self.update_start_game_button_state()  # May use stale state
```

**Fix**: Wait for server state update before updating button state.

---

### 17. Disconnect Event Not Emitted on Manual Disconnect

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 369-408

**Issue**: When manually disconnecting via `disconnect_from_server()`, the disconnected signal is never emitted because `reconnection_enabled` is set to False before disconnect.

**Impact**: Medium - UI may not update properly on manual disconnect.

**Evidence**:
```python
def disconnect_from_server(self):
    # Disable reconnection when manually disconnecting
    self.reconnection_enabled = False
    # ... disconnect ...
    # But the disconnect() event handler checks reconnection_enabled
    # and won't emit signals if it's False
```

**Fix**: Emit disconnected signal explicitly in manual disconnect.

---

### 18. No Validation of Player Names

**Location**: Client and server join/create handlers

**Issue**: No validation of player names (length, special characters, duplicates in room). Could lead to display issues or exploits.

**Impact**: Medium - Potential for UI breaking or confusion.

**Evidence**: No validation code found in join_room or create_room flows.

**Fix**: Add server-side name validation and sanitization.

---

### 19. Time.sleep in Reconnection Logic

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 505-506, 538-539

**Issue**: Using `time.sleep()` in the reconnection logic blocks the event loop and can cause UI freezing.

**Impact**: High - UI freezing during reconnection.

**Evidence**:
```python
def _attempt_reconnection(self):
    try:
        if hasattr(self.sio, 'connected') and self.sio.connected:
            self.sio.disconnect()
            time.sleep(0.1)  # Blocks!
        # ...
        while waited < max_wait:
            # ...
            time.sleep(wait_interval)  # Blocks repeatedly!
```

**Fix**: Use QTimer or async/await properly.

---

### 20. Cleanup Network Resources Sets sio to None

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 410-434

**Issue**: The `cleanup_network_resources()` method sets `self.sio = None`, but other methods check `self.sio.connected` without checking if `sio` is None first, which will cause AttributeError.

**Impact**: Medium - Crashes after cleanup.

**Evidence**:
```python
def cleanup_network_resources(self):
    # ...
    self.sio = None  # Danger!

def send_heartbeat(self):
    if self.connected_to_server and self.sio.connected:  # Will crash if sio is None
```

**Fix**: Check `self.sio is not None` before accessing attributes.

---

### 21. Disconnect Handler Bypasses Room State Management

**Location**: `server/socket_handlers.py` lines 225-265

**Issue**: The disconnect handler directly manipulates player state (`player.disconnected = True`) instead of going through room_manager's leave_room method during active games. This bypasses state validation and creates inconsistent state management paths.

**Impact**: Medium - State management inconsistency, harder to maintain.

**Evidence**:
```python
@sio.event
async def disconnect(sid):
    if game_state == GameState.IN_PROGRESS:
        # Directly modifies player state without going through room_manager
        player.disconnected = True
        # Doesn't call await room_manager.leave_room(sid)
    else:
        # For non-active games, DOES call leave_room
        updated_room = await room_manager.leave_room(sid)
```

**Fix**: Make leave_room handle both cases consistently and always call it, or document why direct manipulation is needed.

---

### 22. No Input Validation for Game Configuration

**Location**: `src/logic/Network.py` lines 706-721 (send_game_config)

**Issue**: Game configuration (start_category, end_category, custom pages) is sent to server without validation. Malformed or malicious input could crash the server or create invalid game states.

**Impact**: Medium-High - Server stability risk.

**Evidence**: No validation in send_game_config or in the corresponding server handler.

**Fix**: Add server-side validation for all game configuration parameters.

---

### 23. Inconsistent Player Count Management

**Location**: Throughout server/room_manager.py and server/models.py

**Issue**: Player count is managed as a separate field `room.player_count` that must be manually synchronized with `len(room.players)`. This creates opportunities for desync.

**Impact**: Medium - State inconsistencies.

**Evidence**: 
```python
# In GameRoom model, player_count is a separate field
# But it should be derived from len(self.players)
```

**Fix**: Make player_count a @property that computes from len(players), or remove it entirely.

---

### 24. Room Code Collision Detection Missing

**Location**: `server/room_manager.py` (create_room method)

**Issue**: Room codes are randomly generated 4-letter codes, but there's no retry logic if a collision occurs (26^4 = 456,976 possible codes, collisions become likely with many rooms).

**Impact**: Low-Medium - Room creation can fail unnecessarily.

**Evidence**: Would need to check create_room implementation for collision handling.

**Fix**: Add retry loop with collision detection or use longer codes.

---
