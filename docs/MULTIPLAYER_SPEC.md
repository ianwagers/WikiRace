# WikiRace Multiplayer Architecture Specification

## Overview

This document defines the architecture and implementation strategy for multiplayer functionality in WikiRace, allowing up to 10 players to compete in real-time Wikipedia navigation races.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Game State Management
The current solo game tracks:
- **Game Timer**: `startTime` (seconds elapsed)
- **Link Counter**: `linksUsed` (number of links clicked)
- **Navigation History**: `previousLinksList` (QListWidget with page titles)
- **Current Page**: Tracked via `onUrlChanged()` events
- **Start/End URLs**: `start_url`, `end_url`, `start_title`, `end_title`
- **Game Completion**: Detected via `checkEndGame()` method

### Current UI Components
- `SoloGamePage`: Main game interface with WebView, sidebar, and controls
- `GameLogic`: Handles page selection and Wikipedia API interactions
- `HomePage`: Entry point with game setup dialogs

## Multiplayer Architecture Design

### 1. Network Architecture

#### Server Component (New)
**Technology Stack**: Flask/FastAPI + Socket.IO for real-time communication
**Deployment**: Self-hosted web server (as mentioned by user)

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Game room management (4-letter codes)
- Player session handling
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Game lifecycle management (lobby → game → results)

#### Client-Server Communication
**Protocol**: WebSocket (Socket.IO) for real-time events
**Fallback**: HTTP REST API for critical operations

**Key Events**:
```python
# Client → Server
'create_room'       # Host creates new game room
'join_room'         # Player joins existing room
'set_profile'       # Player sets display name
'select_categories' # Host selects game parameters
'start_game'        # Host initiates game start
'player_progress'   # Player navigates to new page (enhanced)
'game_complete'     # Player reaches destination

# Server → Client
'room_created'      # Room successfully created
'player_joined'     # New player joined room
'player_left'       # Player left room
'game_starting'     # Game countdown initiated (5-second countdown)
'game_started'      # Game officially begins
'player_progress'   # Other players' progress updates (enhanced)
'player_completed'  # Player completion notification
'game_ended'        # First player completed race
'game_config_updated' # Host configuration broadcast
'reconnecting'      # Reconnection attempt status
'reconnected'       # Successful reconnection
```

    current_page_title: str # Current Wikipedia page title
    links_clicked: int      # Number of links used
    navigation_history: List[NavigationEntry]  # Detailed navigation path
    game_completed: bool    # Whether reached destination
    completion_time: Optional[float]  # Time to complete (seconds)
    game_start_time: Optional[datetime]  # When game started for this player
    joined_at: datetime     # When player joined room
    last_activity: datetime # Last activity timestamp
```

#### NavigationEntry
```python
class NavigationEntry:
    page_url: str           # Full Wikipedia page URL
    page_title: str         # Wikipedia page title
    timestamp: datetime     # When page was visited
    link_number: int        # Sequential link number (0 = start page)
    time_elapsed: float     # Time elapsed since game start (seconds)
```

#### Game State
```python
class GameState(Enum):
    LOBBY = "lobby"         # Players joining, host configuring
    STARTING = "starting"   # Countdown before game begins
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"  # Game actively running
    COMPLETED = "completed" # Game finished, showing results
    ABANDONED = "abandoned" # Room closed/expired
```

   - Clicks "Host Game"
   - Server generates 4-letter room code
   - Host enters lobby as room leader
3. **Join Path**:
   - Enters display name and room code
   - Clicks "Join Game"
   - Server validates room exists and has space
   - Player enters lobby

#### Phase 2: Lobby Configuration
- **All Players**: See real-time list of joined players
- **Host Only**: 
  - Select starting/ending page categories (or custom)
  - Configure game settings
  - "Start Game" button (grayed until ready)
- **Real-time Updates**: Players see configuration changes instantly

#### Phase 3: Game Execution
1. Host clicks "Start Game"
2. Server selects start/end pages using existing GameLogic
3. All players receive same start/end URLs
4. **5-second countdown displayed to all players with visual CountdownDialog**
5. Game begins simultaneously for all players
6. **During Game**:
   - Each player's detailed navigation tracked on server
   - Page changes with URLs and titles broadcast to other players
   - Progress sidebar shows other players' current pages with timestamps
   - Link counts and time elapsed updated in real-time
   - Complete navigation history stored for results

#### Phase 4: Game Completion

### 6. Technical Implementation Strategy

#### Server Setup
1. **Framework**: FastAPI + Socket.IO for real-time communication
2. **Database**: Redis for session storage, room management
3. **Deployment**: Docker container on user's server
4. **Configuration**: Environment variables for host/port settings

#### Client Integration
1. **Minimal Code Changes**: Leverage existing SoloGamePage as base
2. **Wrapper Approach**: MultiplayerGamePage wraps SoloGamePage
3. **Event-Driven**: Use Qt signals/slots for network event handling
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Handle network disconnections gracefully

#### Dependencies
```toml
# Additional dependencies for multiplayer
"python-socketio[client]>=5.8.0"
"websocket-client>=1.6.0"
"python-dotenv>=1.0.0"  # For server configuration
```
