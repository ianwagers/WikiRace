## üêõ CRITICAL BUGS (Must Fix)

### Theme & Visual Issues
- [‚úÖ] **Settings Page Theme Text**: Fix "Theme" text color readability in dark mode
- [‚úÖ] **Solo Game Labels**: Fix "Starting Page" and "Ending Page" text color in dark mode
- [‚úÖ] **Theme Application**: Fix theme not always applied to SoloGamePage on theme changes
- [‚úÖ] **Player Name Dialog**: Fix background/cancel button theming for light mode
- [‚úÖ] **Hide Wikipedia Appearance**: Fix CSS injection to hide the wikipedia appearance options (We don't want other themes than the game setting)
- [‚úÖ] **Congratulations Theme Text**: Fix the theme text color readability of "Congratulations" in the Game Over Dialog (Solo Game)
- [‚úÖ] **Add solid background to the "Start Page" and "End Page" combo-box dropdowns on the Multiplayer game setup**
- [‚úÖ] **Countdown Timer Veritcal Adjustment**: On some displays, the countdown timer is too small vertically and crops text. Fix the minimum height that's appropriate (maybe 550px)
- [‚úÖ] **Host / Join Game Arrangement**: The Multiplayer page gets quite sparce *width-wise* on large displays. Force the Host Game and Join Game dialogs to the left (add a spacer to the layout)


### Game Logic & Timing
- [‚úÖ] **Confetti Timer Bug**: Exclude confetti effect time from total game time calculation on Game Over DIALOG in SOLO games - Not Fixed
- [‚úÖ] **Multiplayer Timer Bug**: In multiplayer games, the timers for players that didn't win are still ticking after the game has ended.
- [‚úÖ] **Solo Tab Cleanup**: Close Solo Game tab after "Continue" button clicked
- [‚úÖ] **Player Progress Reset**: Fix links not resetting to 0 between multiple games
- [‚úÖ] **Rejoin Game Bugs**: Fix strange bugs when rejoining with same player name
- [‚úÖ] **External link handling**: If players click on a link that leads outside of Wikipedia - Send the player to the previous page they were on (using the "back" button functionality)


### Multiplayer Stability
- [‚úÖ] **Room Inactivity Timeout**: Increase timeout from 1-2 minutes to 20 minutes for inactivity
- [‚úÖ] **Room Timeout Behavior**: If a room DOES timeout, all players must be consistently kicked and not have any persistent data from the room
- [‚úÖ] **Player Disconnect Handling**: Test and fix bugs when players leave/close during games - NOT FIXED
- [‚úÖ] **Room Management**: Test and fix joining/leaving/rejoining room bugs - NOT FIXED
        - Players who click "Leave Room" should be returned to the home page and the server needs to delete all data for that player
        - Players who leave a room, then rejoin the room with the same name or a new name are not shown a PlayerColorPicker
            - This is independant of rooms, creating a new room doesn't fix the issue, this happens for leaders and non-leaders
- [‚úÖ] **Multiplayer Exit Game**: Players who click "Exit to Home" then click Multiplayer from the home page see their last room (it should be reset to Join/Host game) - HAVE THE APP FULLY CLOSE THE MULTIPLAYER TAB WHEN THIS OCCURS
        - Clicking "Exit to Home" from the PlayerResultsDialog does not close the multiplayer game room
        - If one player clicks "Exit to Home" then another player clicks "Play again" the player who left the room is still shown in the game room

## üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS (High Priority)

### Multiplayer Page Layout
- [‚úÖ] **Join Game Width**: Cap "Join a Game" layout at ~600px width
- [‚úÖ] **Host Game Width**: Cap "Host a Game" layout at ~600px width
- [‚úÖ] **Verify cross-platform support**: Ensure all multiplayer pages and elements look great on laptops with 1080p displays or different aspect ratios
- [‚úÖ] **Color Picker Height**: Fix excessive height with QV layout and spacers
    - ISSUE: The color picker is still too tall. Add spacers below the color picker
- [‚úÖ] **Color Button Sizing**: Make color selection buttons 4x larger with rounded outlines
    - ISSUE: The color picker always overlaps with the room code. Make color sizing dynamic dependant on the main application window size
- [‚úÖ] **Color Picker Borders**: Remove visible borders in dark mode - NOT IMPLEMENTED IN DARK MODE - Light mode looks good
- [‚úÖ] **Color Picker Consistency**: Remove borders, ensure consistent backgrounds for both themes - NOT IMPLEMENTED - Backgrounds around "Choose your color" are not the same as those on the multiplayer pages  
- [‚úÖ] **Color Picker Text**: Increase text size for "Choose your color" and "Selected color"

### Countdown & Progress
- [‚úÖ] **Countdown Dialog Size**: Halve size and enable text wrapping
- [‚úÖ] **Player Progress Font**: Increase font size for player name and links
- [‚úÖ] **Race Lights Sequence**: Fix sequence (Red on 3, Yellow on 2, Green on 1 and GO!)

## üìã IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Priority Order
1. **Critical Bugs** - Game-breaking issues that affect core functionality
2. **UI/UX Improvements** - Visual and usability issues that impact user experience  
3. **Configuration & Cleanup** - Code cleanup and feature removal
4. **Enhancements** - Nice-to-have features for polish

### Technical Considerations
- All theme fixes should be tested in both light and dark modes
- Multiplayer fixes require testing with multiple clients
- UI changes should maintain responsive design principles
- File storage changes need migration logic for existing users

### Testing Requirements
- Test all multiplayer scenarios (join/leave/rejoin/name changes)
- Verify theme consistency across all pages and dialogs
- Test game timing accuracy and progress tracking
- Validate file storage migration works correctly
